# Age-aware placeholder rule. Found via error analysis: the model's worst
# predictions were recent cars at absurd prices — a 2024 Tiguan R.LINE at
# 5,555 DH, a 2026 GWM Tank 500 at 6,300 DH, a 2022 Kia Picanto at 11,500 DH.
# Same contact-bait intent as the 1 DH listings above, just using less obvious
# numbers (5,555 / 10,101 / 11,111) that cleared the flat PRICE_MIN floor.
#
# Deliberately age-aware, not a higher flat floor: raising PRICE_MIN to 30,000
# would delete genuinely cheap old cars (a 1987 Peugeot 205 at 10,000 DH and a
# 1998 Renault R11 at 8,500 DH are real prices). The signal is price relative
# to age, not price alone.
#
# Cost: 130 rows = 0.57% of the dataset, and widening the band barely moves
# that (age<=8 & price<25,000 catches 119; price<40,000 catches 138), which
# says the cutoff sits in empty territory rather than slicing real listings.

# Peer-ratio rule for absurdly HIGH prices. The mirror image of the
# placeholder rule above, and found the same way: a 2018 Golf appeared in
# the data at 2,700,000 DH, which the model duly learned from.
#
# The mechanism is Moroccan-specific and worth naming. One flagged row
# reads "Dacia Logan à vendre, prix convenable 13 millions" with a price
# of 1,300,000 — the seller means 13 million CENTIMES (1 DH = 100
# centimes), i.e. 130,000 DH, which is normal Moroccan speech for car
# prices. Entered into a dirham field, it inflates by ~10x. That is why
# the flagged ratios cluster tightly around 10-11x rather than spreading
# out.
#
# PRICE_MAX cannot catch these: 780,000 DH for a 2011 Dacia Logan is
# absurd but nowhere near the 5,000,000 phone-number ceiling. The signal
# is price relative to the same brand+model+year PEER GROUP, not price
# in absolute terms.
#
# Cost: 105 rows = 0.46%. Inspection showed zero legitimate cars in the
# flagged set. The threshold is safe because the distribution is bimodal:
# >3x flags 110 rows and >8x flags 91, so almost nothing sits in the
